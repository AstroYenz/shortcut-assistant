**Privacy Policy for Shortcut Assistant**

**Introduction**

Welcome to the Privacy Policy for Shortcut Assistant, a Chrome extension designed to enhance your browsing experience. This policy outlines how we handle your personal information and your privacy rights. It also addresses our use of Sentry for error tracking and the optional use of an API key for enhanced functionality.

**Information Collection and Use**

The use of an API key in Shortcut Assistant is optional. If you choose not to provide an API key, the extension sends story descriptions to a proxy server managed by us, where they are forwarded to OpenAI. The following points outline our data handling:

1. **API Key Usage (Optional):** If provided, the API key is stored locally on your device and used solely for making direct API requests to OpenAI during your browser session. It is not transmitted to any external servers, including our proxy server.

2. **Proxy Server Data Handling:** When the API key is not provided, story descriptions are sent to our proxy server. While no data is stored permanently, logs of requests are collected and retained for 7 days to prevent abuse of the extension and to enable us to block nefarious requests.

3. **Data Security:** We implement appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data. This includes secure data handling by our proxy server and Sentry.

4. **Sentry Data Handling:** Sentry collects anonymous error and performance data to help us identify and fix potential issues with Shortcut Assistant. Data collected by Sentry is subject to their privacy policy and is used solely for improving the functionality and stability of Shortcut Assistant.

**User Consent**

By using Shortcut Assistant, you consent to the optional provision of your API key, the forwarding of story descriptions to our proxy server (when the API key is not provided), and to the anonymous data collection by Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
